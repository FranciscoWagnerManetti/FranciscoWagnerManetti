Hi, I'm Francisco, a Master's student in Big Data Analytics at UC3M in Madrid.

With experience in organizing and communicating complex ideas, I can engage both technical and non-technical audiences in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to learn and grow through teamwork.
